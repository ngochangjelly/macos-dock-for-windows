# macOS-style dock for Windows 10

[![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/ronilaukkarinen/macos-dock-for-windows.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/ronilaukkarinen/macos-dock-for-windows/releases) [![Reddit](https://badgen.net/reddit/post-karma/u/Qllervo?style=flat-square)](https://www.reddit.com/r/desktops/comments/mzslxe/my_windows_10_is_now_perfect/)

Because using macOS daily I also want my Windows to look as minimal as possible. Dock is something I'm just used to instead of bulky start menus. This is why I tried to replicate it with Adobe Photoshop as close as possible. The dock is fully designed by me, following [macOS Design Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/overview/themes/).
